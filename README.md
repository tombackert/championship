# Project Championship

### Goal
- Predict the upcoming Premier League champion


### Idea
- I'm no data scientist, neither a football analyst (eventhough I know a fair amount). So why not let a neural network figure out the correlations in the data that lead a team to the championship? I was good at building predicter systems in the past, so let's build a predicter to predict the upcoming champion

### Milestones
- Market analysis
- Decision on data
- Decision on model type
- Decision on mpv strat
- MPV development
- Make it a product!
- Make it better! (Delete, optimize, accelerate, automate)
- Scale it!
